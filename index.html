    <h2>
    My strengths: 
    </h2>
   <p>
     I have good muscle control, mainly because I play badminton <strong>almost </strong>every day :>
    </p> 
    <p>
      I also am very good at painting in acrylic. I feel that at the start of everyone's art journey, whether or not they go on this journey,
      they are taught all the art mediums known. (For example, charcoal, watercolor, acrylic, oil and chalk pastels, colored pencils etc.) However, as
      they progress, they will start to find their "forte" medium. Another example would be how I practiced in all the mediums, but even though I did well, I found that
      I could not really <strong>enjoy</strong> doing the other mediums as much as I did in acrylic. (Hopefully, I will enjoy oil paint as well, haha-)
    </p>
    <p>
      I also like writing small stories, could be one of the reasons I excel in ELA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I exceed in playing the piano and the violin.

    <h2>
      Things I need to work on:
    </h2>
    <p>
     I do need to practice more in music theory, but I'm getting there, I'm getting there.
